Assignment 0

##Mastering technique

Assignment 1

##Capturing a moment in time

Using both monochromatic transmission and reflection, students will set up still shots of objects they have curated and shoot three holograms, using either transmission or reflection. The pieces should work as a triptych.

Assignment 2

##Mixed media

How can holography work with other media? Students are encouraged to use words, performance, digital pieces, etc. to create a work that intertwines holography. These works will make use of full color transmission and or reflection holograms

Assignment 3

##Break the Rules

Holography has very strict rules for shooting an "ideal" hologram. But art gives us permission to break them and be experimental. Students will come up with a concept that leans toward breaking the techniques we've learned, using any of the types of holograms we've covered (with intro to 4x5 holograms).

Assignment 4

##Collaboration

Holographic printing allows for quick outsourcing of holograms and full use of 3d modeling and frames. The class will come up with a theme to cover, and each student will contribute a model to a class hologram that will be displayed on the ATS floor.

Assignment 5

##Tell a story

Students will create a 3d modeled story to submit to be printed, making use of multiple channels if they so desire. They may choose between printing mono or full color, based off price.
